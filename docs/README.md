# Judey User Guide

**Judey** is a friendly astronaut-cat chatbot for organising your tasks. You can use it to record todos, deadlines, and events, then manage them from the task list.

## Getting started

### Prerequisite

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 25

To get started:

1. Download the latest `judey.jar` from the project's [Releases page](https://github.com/Umaiza-15/ip/releases).
1. Create an empty folder where you want Judey to store your task data.
1. Place the downloaded JAR file inside that folder.
1. Open a terminal in that folder.
1. Run the following command:

   ```text
   java -jar judey.jar
   ```

The Judey window will open with a chat box for entering commands. Your tasks will be saved in a `data` subfolder as `data/judey.txt`.

Your tasks are saved automatically in `data/judey.txt`, so they will still be available the next time you start Judey from the same folder.

## Using Judey

Type one command at a time, then press **Enter** or click **Send**. Task numbers are assigned by the order shown by `list`, starting from 1.

### Quick start

Try these commands in order:

```text
todo buy groceries
deadline submit assignment /by 25/9/2026 2359
event project meeting /from 26/9/2026 1400 /to 26/9/2026 1500
list
mark 1
```

Use the task number shown by `list` when marking, unmarking, or deleting a task.

### Command format

- Commands are **case-sensitive**. Use lowercase commands such as `todo`, `list`, and `bye`.
- Text in angle brackets, such as `<description>` or `<task number>`, is a placeholder. Replace it with your own value, and do not type the angle brackets.
- Dates and times use `d/M/yyyy HHmm`, with a 24-hour clock. For example, `2/12/2026 1800` means 2 December 2026 at 6:00 PM.
- Use the markers exactly as shown: `/by`, `/from`, and `/to`. Do not insert spaces inside them or change their spelling.
- A deadline needs one `/by` marker. An event needs both `/from` and `/to`, in that order. Include a description before the marker.
- Separate the command and its arguments with spaces, but do not add extra characters or punctuation to the command names or markers.

## Command summary

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `todo <description>` | Add a todo task. |
| `deadline <description> /by <date and time>` | Add a task with a deadline. |
| `event <description> /from <date and time> /to <date and time>` | Add an event with a start and end time. |
| `list` | Display all tasks, their numbers, types, and completion status. |
| `mark <task number>` | Mark a task as completed. |
| `unmark <task number>` | Mark a task as incomplete. |
| `delete <task number>` | Delete a task. |
| `events-on <date>` | Show deadlines and events on a specific date. |
| `find <keyword>` | Find tasks whose descriptions contain the keyword. |
| `help` | Display Judey's built-in command guide. |
| `bye` | Exit Judey. |

## Command details

### Add tasks

| Command | What it does | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `todo <description>` | Adds a task with no date. | `todo read a book` |
| `deadline <description> /by <date and time>` | Adds a task with a due date. | `deadline submit report /by 2/12/2026 2359` |
| `event <description> /from <date and time> /to <date and time>` | Adds a task with a start and end time. | `event team meeting /from 15/10/2026 1400 /to 15/10/2026 1600` |

For dates and times, use `d/M/yyyy HHmm` format:

```text
2/12/2026 1800
```

The time uses 24-hour notation. For example, `1800` means 6:00 PM.

### Manage tasks

- `list` — shows every task, its number, completion status, and task type. The type tag is `[T]` for a todo, `[D]` for a deadline, and `[E]` for an event. An incomplete task has `[ ]`; a completed task has `[X]`.
- `mark <task number>` — marks a task as done. When you run `list`, its status changes to `[X]`. Example: `mark 1`
- `unmark <task number>` — marks a completed task as incomplete again. When you run `list`, its status changes back to `[ ]`. Example: `unmark 1`
- `delete <task number>` — permanently removes the selected task from the list. Example: `delete 1`

For example, this `list` output means task 1 is an incomplete todo, task 2 is a completed deadline, and task 3 is an incomplete event:

```text
1.[T][ ] buy groceries
2.[D][X] submit assignment (by: Sep 25 2026, 11:59PM)
3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Sep 26 2026, 2:00PM to Sep 26 2026, 3:00PM)
```

### Find events by date

Use `events-on <date: d/M/yyyy>` to show events occurring on a particular date. The date must use `d/M/yyyy` format:

```text
events-on 2/12/2026
```

### Find tasks by description

Use `find <keyword>` to search task descriptions. Searches are case-insensitive and may contain multiple words.
Matching tasks are shown in their original task-list order and keep their original task numbers.

```text
find project meeting
```

If no task matches, Judey displays:

```text
Here are the matching tasks in your mission log:
No matching tasks found in this sector.
```

The search keyword is required. For example, entering only `find` displays an error with the correct format.

### Missing or invalid command arguments

The `mark`, `unmark`, `delete`, and `events-on` commands report missing or invalid arguments with a correction
example. In the GUI, the missing or invalid value is highlighted in that example. For example, entering `mark`
shows:

```text
The mark command is missing a task number.

Try: mark <task number>
```

For `events-on`, the correction includes the required date format:

```text
The events-on command is missing a date.

Try: events-on <date: d/M/yyyy>
```

The highlighting is GUI-only; the command-line interface displays the same correction without visual highlighting.
Task numbers must be positive whole numbers. A positive number that is not present in the task list produces a
separate task-not-found error.

### The `help` command

Enter `help` when you need a reminder of the available commands. Judey displays the command groups, expected formats, and examples for adding, managing, and filtering tasks. Use the examples as templates: replace values such as `<description>` and `<task number>` with your own information, but keep the command names and `/by`, `/from`, and `/to` markers unchanged.

`help` does not change your task list and does not accept extra text. Enter only:

```text
help
```

### The `bye` command

Enter `bye` when you are finished. Judey displays a goodbye message and closes the application.

Tasks that you added or changed during the session are saved automatically as each command is completed. They remain in `data/judey.txt` and will be loaded the next time you start Judey from the same folder.

```text
bye
```

## Common problems

| Problem | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| Judey does not start | Check that JDK 25 is installed, that your terminal is open in the folder containing `judey.jar`, and that you ran `java -jar judey.jar`. |
| A command is not recognised | Commands are case-sensitive. Use the lowercase command names shown in this guide, such as `todo` or `list`. |
| A date or time is rejected | Use `d/M/yyyy HHmm`, such as `25/9/2026 2359`, and use a 24-hour clock. |
| An event or deadline is rejected | Check that the description is present and that you used the markers exactly as `/by`, `/from`, and `/to`. Do not type the angle brackets from the examples. |
| A task number is rejected | Run `list` and use the current number shown beside the task. Task numbers start at 1. |
| The task list is empty | Add a task first, then run `list`. If previously saved tasks are missing, make sure you started Judey from the same folder as before so it can find `data/judey.txt`. |
| An error message is unclear | For `mark`, `unmark`, `delete`, and `events-on`, the GUI highlights the value that is missing or incorrect in the suggested command. Replace that part and submit the command again. |

## Tips

- Use `list` before `mark`, `unmark`, or `delete` if you are unsure of a task number.
- If a command is invalid or missing information, Judey shows an example of the expected format. In the GUI, the highlighted part of that example shows what was wrong or missing. Correct that part and try again.
- Keep the `/by`, `/from`, and `/to` markers exactly as shown in the examples.
